# Website-Project-1
Website Named 'Don't Give Up'. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome & normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
